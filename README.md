# Foundry Bootstrap

Use Foundry.Bootstrap to quickly get you started building an
application with Foundry.

This serves as a starting point that works right out of the box.

## Getting Started

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the [Bower JavaScript package manager](http://bower.io/).
3. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
4. Clone or [download the zip file](https://github.com/gburghardt/foundry.bootstrap/archive/master.zip) for this repository.
5. Install the base dependencies from the command line:

        cd path/to/this/repository
        bower install

6. Build the JavaScript package

        grunt

If you already have NodeJS and Bower installed:

    bower install foundry.bootstrap
